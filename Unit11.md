**Unit 11: Stellar Evolution** <span id="11"></span> 
*In this unit, you will be introduced to the way in which stars change
over time.  You will learn about the history of our sun and about its
future.  You will learn how elements more massive than helium came to be
and how they became available to the universe for the production of
later generations of stars and their planets.*

**Unit 11 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 14 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 11.1: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 11.2: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 11.3: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 11.4: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Assessment: 2 hours

**Unit11 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Identify the conditions that led to the formation of a star from a
    cloud of interstellar matter.
-   List the sequence of internal changes that occur in a low mass star,
    such as our sun, as it evolves from a main-sequence star to a dead
    star.
-   Compare and contrast the sequence of internal changes that occur in
    the evolution of a high-mass star with those that occur in a
    low-mass star.
-   List at least three properties that distinguish a white dwarf from a
    neutron star.
