**Unit 12: The Formation of the Earth** <span id="12"></span> 
*In this unit you will be introduced to our current model for the
formation of the solar system, with a particular emphasis on the
formation of the earth.  You will learn of the conditions on earth soon
after its formation and how those conditions were transformed by
geological evolution to its present, life-friendly environment.*

**Unit 12 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 12 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 12.1: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 12.2: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 12.3: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 12.4: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Assessment: 2 hours

**Unit12 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Outline the principle features of the nebular hypothesis for the
    formation of the solar system, including the two additions to this
    hypothesis made in the twentieth century.
-   Compare and contrast the present earth with the earth just after it
    formed and identify the specific geological processes that produced
    these differences.
-   List the crucial sequence of events that led from the big bang to
    the rise of life on earth.
