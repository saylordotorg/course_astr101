**Unit 14: Extraterrestrial Life** <span id="14"></span> 
*In this chapter, you will be introduced to our current thoughts on the
existence of life beyond the confines of earth.  Drawing on our
understanding of the development of life on earth, we will speculate on
its existence elsewhere.  We will look at the Drake equation, a formula
for estimating the number of technological civilizations that exist in
our galaxy now, and review the arguments over the existence of
extraterrestrial life.*

    Planet in Habitable Zone”**

     Instructions: This reading discusses the finding of an extrasolar
    planet within the habitable zone of its star.  The discovery was
    made by the Kepler observatory, whose mission is to hunt for
    earth-sized alien planets in the habitable zone of their parent
    star, where liquid water, and perhaps life, might be able to
    exist.

     Instructions: This site describes the various terms in the Drake
    equation.  It also allows you to put in the values you think are
    most appropriate for each term, and it will calculate what the
    expected number of potentially communicating civilizations there are
    in our galaxy.
