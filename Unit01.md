**Unit 1: The Greeks** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, you will be introduced to the worldview established by
the ancient Greeks.  The Greeks are credited with being the first to
attempt natural explanations for natural phenomena and thus with the
birth of science.  We trace the development of Greek astronomy from
Thales in the sixth century Before the Common Era (BCE) through to
Ptolemy in the second century of the Common Era (CE).*
