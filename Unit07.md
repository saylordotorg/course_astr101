**Unit 7: The Big Bang Theory of the Early Universe** <span
id="7"></span> 
*In this unit, you will be introduced to the history of our current
model of the early universe, the big bang, and some of the evidence
supporting.  This is not a model of the origin of the universe; those
conditions transcend our present state of knowledge.  Rather it is a
description of the very early universe.*

This unit should take approximately 9 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 7.1: 1.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 7.2: 2.5 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 7.3: 2 hours

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Compare and contrast Lemaitre’s model of the early universe with
    Gamow’s.
-   Identify the two most significant predictions of the big bang model.
-   Compare and contrast the big bang model with the steady state theory
    of the universe.
-   Identify the single most important evidence in favor of the big
