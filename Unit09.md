**Unit 9: Modern Cosmology** <span id="9"></span> 
*In this unit, you will be introduced to the very latest information on
the nature of the universe.  This information was mostly obtained by a
space probe called WMAP (the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe)
designed to study the cosmic background radiation.  Some important
outcomes of that study are the age of the universe and the detailed
contents of the universe, both at the present time and at the time of
the formation of the cosmic background radiation.*

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 9 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.1: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.2: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.3: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.4: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.5: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.6: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Assessment: 2 hours

**Unit9 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Compare and contrast the roles of gravity and dark energy in the
    expansion of the universe.
-   List at least four facts about the universe that were determined by
    WMAP.
-   Compare and contrast the contents of the universe at the time the
    cosmic background radiation formed and the present.
-   Compare and contrast the three possible geometries for the universe
    and identify which is most consistent with the WMAP data.

     Instructions: This article covers our very latest information on
    the properties of the universe.  It is much more in depth than the
    other units in the course.  Read it carefully, but the details of
    exactly how the data from the cosmic background radiation actually
    determines the age, contents, and structure of the universe is well
    beyond the scope of the course.  Look over the Learning Outcomes for
    the unit and make sure that you have a good start on achieving those
    even if some of the content of the unit is a little beyond you.  
      
     Reading this article should take approximately 1 hour.

     Instructions: This lecture is a repeat of one you watched in an
    earlier unit.  It is repeated here because this unit deals with the
    contents of the universe, and dark matter is one of the most
    significant components.  It also discusses dark energy.

    results obtained from the data.  
      
     Exploring this page should take approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: This is an image you have seen before, but it is well
    worth spending some time studying it and thinking about the wealth
    of information it contains.  It represents the evolution of the
    visible universe with the vertical axis representing size and the
    horizontal axis representing time.  The slope of the containing
    shape represents the rate at which space is expanding.  The
    extremely steep slope near the beginning represents the rapid
    expansion of inflation.  During most of the history, the curvature
    of the containing shape curves downward, representing the slowing
    down of expansion due to gravity.  For the right-hand side, the
    containing shape curves upward, representing the acceleration of
    expansion due to the fact that the consequences of dark energy
    (repulsion) now have surpassed the consequences of gravity
    (attraction).  
      
     Studying this image should take approximately 15 minutes.
