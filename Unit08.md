**Unit 8: The Early Universe** <span id="8"></span> 
*In this unit, you will be introduced to the events occurring in the
first few hundred thousand years of the existence of the universe.  You
will learn how the expansion of space cooled the universe, allowing a
progressive hierarchy of structures to develop, from protons and
neutrons through the formation of neutral atoms and the production of
the cosmic background radiation.*

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 7 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.1: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.2: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Assessment: 2 hours

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   List the sequence of formation of structures in the early history of
    the universe.
-   Identify and explain the role of expanding space in development of
    structures in the early universe.
-   List the most significant properties of the cosmic background
    radiation.
-   Compare and contrast the state of the universe before and after the
    formation of the cosmic background radiation.

     Instructions: This page contains information and animations on the
    formations of protons and neutrons in the early universe.  The
    animation on nucleosynthesis only shows the first step of the
    process, the combining of a proton and a neutron.  At the bottom of
    the site, there is a link titled “Cosmic Conundrums: Era 2.”  Click
    on it to take a short quiz.  
      
     Exploring this site should take approximately 15 minutes.
