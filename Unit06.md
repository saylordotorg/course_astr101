**Unit 6: The Present Universe** <span id="6"></span> 
*In this unit, you will be introduced to the contemporary worldview, the
worldview developed in the twentieth century, replacing the modern
worldview.  Its essential features are the distribution of matter in the
universe and the concept that the space containing this matter is not
the passive void of the modern worldview but rather a dynamic structure
whose expansion is driving the evolution of the universe.*

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: This article discusses Hubble’s Law, which is the
    relationship between recessional velocity and distance.  Recessional
    velocity mistakenly suggests the redshift in the spectra of distant
    galaxies is a Doppler shift, which it is not.  We will later learn
    that the redshift is caused by the expansion of space rather than
    motion through space.  It also shows the observational evidence for
    Hubble’s Law.

    redshift) and redshift caused by the expansion of space
    (cosmological redshift).  Make sure you understand what redshift
    measures.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: This article is the most detailed of the three
    readings on the balloon model and clearly explains how the balloon
    model indicates that the universe has no center.  This is a
    difficult fact to visualize but an important property of the
    universe.  Make sure that this is clear to you, because in the next
    unit we will discuss the big bang model, a concept that leaves most
    people thinking that the center of the universe is where the big
    bang occurred.  This is a serious misconception.  As this article
    explains, there is no center to the universe.

     Instructions: This lecture discusses dark matter and the evidence
    for its existence.  It also introduces the concept of dark energy
    (totally different from dark matter), which is not covered in this
    unit but will be very important in later units.  Think about it now
    and you will be better prepared for the later material.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: This site very nicely discusses the distinction
    between the visible universe and the universe.  You may sometimes
    hear on TV someone say that early in the history of the universe, it
    was the size of a pea.  What they should have said was the visible
    universe was the size of a pea.  The universe probably is, and
    always has been, infinitely large.  The pea analogy for the universe
    is bad because it implies that the universe, like a pea, has a
    center and edges, which it cannot.  The visible universe, however,
    does have an edge.  We can only see out so far in all directions, so
    in that sense the visible, or observable, universe does have an
    edge.  Looking at it this way, you could say that we are at the
    center of the visible universe.  This would equally be true of any
    other observer anywhere in the universe.  Thus, the universe
    actually has no specific center.
