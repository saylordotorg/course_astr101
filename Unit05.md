**Unit 5: Matter and Light** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, you will be introduced to some basic physics that is used
to describe the universe.  The most obvious components of the physical
universe are matter and light, though it turns out to be a bit more
complicated than that.  Matter is composed of atoms, which, for our
purposes, will be described by the Bohr model.  We now know that light
is just part of a larger phenomenon known as electromagnetic radiation.
 The physics of this unit will be the basis for the later units on the
evolution of the universe from its beginning to the present.*

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   List the advances in our knowledge of the atom from the time of
    Democritus to the present.
-   Compare and contrast the Bohr model of the atom to earlier models.
-   Compare and contrast the differences between the wave and particle
    models for light and list the nineteenth-century evidence in favor
    of the wave model.
-   List the major divisions of the electromagnetic spectrum.
-   Compare and contrast bright-line emission spectra with dark-line
    absorption spectra, including the mechanism for their production
    according to the Bohr model of the atom.

     Instructions: This article provides a brief history of our models
    of light and other types of electromagnetic radiation.  It will
    introduce you to the strange concept that light sometimes behaves as
    if it were a wave and sometimes as if it were a stream of particles,
    even though these two models are logically incompatible with one
    another.  Scientists use one or the other depending on which is most
    helpful in their particular application.  In most applications in
    astronomy, it is easiest to think of light as a wave.
