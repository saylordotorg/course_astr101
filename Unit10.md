**Unit 10: The Properties of Stars** <span id="10"></span> 
*In this unit, you will be introduced to the properties of stars and how
they are determined.  You will learn about the Hertzsprung-Russell
diagram, one of the most important tools we have for understanding the
evolution of stars, the topic for the next unit.*

**Unit 10 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 11 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 10.1: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 10.2: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 10.3: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Assessment: 2 hours

**Unit10 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   List the important properties of the sun along with the range of
    these properties in other stars.
-   Describe the conditions at the center of the sun in terms of
    temperature, chemical composition, and state of ionization.
-   Define apparent brightness and luminosity and describe the
    relationship between these two properties and distance to the star.
-   Draw a typical Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and label the axes.
-   Place stars with specific properties in the appropriate locations on
    the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.
