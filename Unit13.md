**Unit 13: Biological Evolution** <span id="13"></span> 
*In this unit, you will be introduced to the concept that species arise
through the modification of earlier forms of life.  Particular emphasis
will be placed on the line of descent of human beings through
vertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, primates, and eventually,
us.*

**Unit 13 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 9 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 13.1: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 13.2: 4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 13.3: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Assignment: 1 hour

**Unit13 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Produce a timeline for the evolution of life from its earliest
    existence to our species, *Homo sapiens*.
-   Identify the defining difference between fish and earlier forms of
    life.
-   Identify the defining difference between amphibians and fish.
-   Identify the defining difference between reptiles and amphibians.
-   Identify the defining difference between mammals and reptiles.
-   Identify the defining difference between primates and mammals.
-   List at least five species on the hominid line of descent.
