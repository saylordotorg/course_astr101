**Unit 4: The Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution** <span
id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, you will be introduced to the changes that occurred in
our model of the universe in the seventeenth century.  The Greek
worldview will be replaced with the modern worldview.  (*Note: Do not
mistake the “modern worldview” for our current worldview.  In the
twentieth century, the modern worldview was replaced with the
“contemporary worldview.”*)  This modern worldview was based on advances
in science made during the Scientific Revolution, specifically on the
work of Isaac Newton.*

     Instructions: In this article, you will be introduced to
    calculations using Kepler’s third law.  This law relates the average
    distance between the sun and a planet to the amount of time it takes
    the planet to orbit the sun (its period) by a simple algebraic
    formula.  You will need a calculator that can cube numbers and take
    cube roots.  Practice this calculation for several of the planets,
    sometimes starting with the period and calculating the average
    distance, sometimes *vice versa*.  Here is the data you can use for
    the calculations.  The second column is the average distance between
    the planet and the sun, and the third column is the period of
    revolution of the planet around the sun.
