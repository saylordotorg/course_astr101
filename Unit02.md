**Unit 2: The Celestial Sphere** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, you will be introduced to the celestial sphere, the
physical model the Greeks used to understand celestial phenomena.  Its
essential feature is that, in addition to the fixed stars, it contains
seven wanderers: the sun, the moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn.  These wanderers wander through the fixed stars in an orderly
way to produce the observed celestial events, including the phases of
the moon and eclipses.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 7 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.1: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 2.2: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Assessment: 2 hours

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Define the following: ecliptic, zodiac, celestial equator, winter
    solstice, autumnal equinox, summer solstice, and vernal equinox.
-   Draw and label a diagram that explains why the earth experiences
    seasons and why the seasons are reversed in the northern and
    southern hemispheres.
-   Draw and label a diagram that explains the phases of the moon.
-   Draw and label diagrams that explain lunar and solar eclipses.

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: This is a more detailed treatment of the celestial
    coordinate system than what was presented in the previous article.
     Most students find the coordinate system a little confusing.  Don’t
    worry too much about the units used for Right Ascension; just focus
    on the coordinate system and understanding the parallels between it
    and latitude and longitude on earth.  
      
     Reading this article should take approximately 20 minutes.

     Instructions: This is a brief article that will introduce you to
    the ecliptic and the zodiac.  In the summer, the sun is further
    north on the celestial sphere; therefore, for people in the northern
    hemisphere, it is above the horizon for more than 12 hours per day.
     The reverse is true in winter.
